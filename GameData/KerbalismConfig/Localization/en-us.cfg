		// Parts Localization

		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_MohoSrfLanded = The Geiger counter agrees that Moho would be cooler with lava. The KSC has informed you that talking to the Geiger counter is strictly forbidden.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_EveSrfLanded = It seems that high radiation levels are the one thing you don't have to worry about on the surface of Eve.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_GillySrfLanded = You are having too much fun bouncing around to check the radiation levels.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_KerbinSrfLanded = Radiation levels are quite literally nominal here on Kerbin. Something must be blocking the radiation.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_MunSrfLanded = Radiation on the surface of the Mun is fairly high, any future habitation would require more shielding.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_MinmusSrfLanded = Looking at the radiation levels, you regret tasting the surface of Minmus.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_DunaSrfLanded = These results are critical for the development of a Duna colony. Shame if something were to happen to them...
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_IkeSrfLanded = The surface contains a trace amount of radioactive compounds, R&D believed these are elements created by interactions between solar wind and Duna's atmosphere.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_DresSrfLanded = Cross referencing these results with surface samples, Dres seems to consist of a large amount of heavy, radioactive metals
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_LaytheSrfLanded = Laythe's atmosphere and active core protect its surface from Jool's intense radiation belt, but the background radiation is significantly higher than Kerbin's
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_VallSrfLanded = Vall is fortunate enough to not be located in Jool's radiation belt, but the radiation on the surface is still significant.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_TyloSrfLanded = The functioning magnetosphere Tylo possesses is enough to shield the planet from most of Jool's radiation, but its lack of atmosphere means a significant amount of radiation still reaches the surface
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_BopSrfLanded = KSC warns against trying to locate the intense source of radiation they spotted from orbit.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_PolSrfLanded = It seems that Pol contains a large amount of radioactive Hydrogen and Helium isotopes, deposited by Jool over thousands of years.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_EelooSrfLanded = This far from Kerbol, much more interstellar radiation reaches the surface. This would be a great place for future study
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_EveFlyingLow = Eve's thick atmosphere and large magnetosphere prevents any radiation from reaching this altitude.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_KerbinFlyingLow = The vibrations from your rocket make the dials unreadable, so you decide to make up the results.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_DunaFlyingLow = The atmosphere seems to block more radiation then originally predicted. This bodes well for future Duna missions.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_JoolFlyingLow = You go to check the Geiger counter, but it refuses to display a reading until you take it out of the atmosphere.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_LaytheFlyingLow = The oceans below emit an unexpected amount of radiation.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_EveFlyingHigh = You are too busy trying not to burn up in the atmosphere to look at the Geiger counter.

		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_SunInSpaceLow = It's over 9000!!
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_MohoInSpaceLow = R&D informs you that these results have contributed to a scientific breakthrough. You are too busy hugging the air conditioner to care.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_EveInSpaceLow = Eve's atmosphere emits strange ions that throw off your readings.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_GillyInSpaceLow = The radiation levels here flux because of Gilly's eccentric orbit and Eve's magnetosphere.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_KerbinInSpaceLow = The radiation environment up there is more complex than we throught. This should give R&D something new to study.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_MunInSpaceLow = You notice a steady pulse of radiation as you pass over the dark side of the Mun. It's probably nothing.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_MinmusInSpaceLow = The results indicate that Minmus has large amounts of radioactive compounds mixed within the icy crust.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_DunaInSpaceLow = The sun is stripping away Duna's fragile atmosphere, as Duna is emitting a stream of ionized particles.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_IkeInSpaceLow = Ike's close orbit and tidally locked state means that when you are over the side of Ike facing Duna the radiation levels drop immensely.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_DresInSpaceLow = The Geiger counter has detected large amounts of radiation originating from Dres.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_JoolInSpaceLow = KSC has advised that you will not be allowed to return for fear that you will contaminate the rest of Kerbalkind
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_LaytheInSpaceLow = As you look down at the beautiful ocean below, you forget that you are slowly dying of radiation poisoning.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_VallInSpaceLow = Amazingly, the radiation levels are at a reasonable level.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_TyloInSpaceLow = The subtle magnetosphere of Tylo acts as a generator, magnifying Jool's already intense radiation field.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_BopInSpaceLow = Bop has an abnormally high amount of radiation that seems to be pin-pointed at 68 degrees north, 114 degrees east. Strange
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_PolInSpaceLow = The space around Pol is filled with radioactive ions that have been unfortunate enough to be caught by Jool's magnetosphere.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_EelooInSpaceLow = R&D is keen to study what effects the large amount of interstellar radiation has done to the surface of Eeloo.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_SunInSpaceHigh = The KSC informs you that they *may* have forgotten to add the shielding.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_MohoInSpaceHigh = The radiation from the sun has picked up dramatically over the course of your journey.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_EveInSpaceHigh = You are not looking forward to traveling through Eve's radiation belt.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_GillyInSpaceHigh = You refuse to check the radiation levels unless the KSC stops making Potato puns.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_KerbinInSpaceHigh = This place is dangerous.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_MunInSpaceHigh = You crossed Kerbin's radiation belt, and did not die. You worry that this will spawn a bunch of crazy conspiracy theories.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_MinmusInSpaceHigh = You pick up an abnormal amount of radiation, but can't figure out the origin.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_DunaInSpaceHigh = Duna doesn’t seem to have a magnetosphere, so cosmic radiation will be a problem for future Duna missions.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_IkeInSpaceHigh = Unexpectedly, Ike appears to be magnetic enough to mess with the ion's striped from Duna's atmosphere.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_DresInSpaceHigh = In the asteroid, nobody can hear you face palm when you realise that you forgot the Geiger counter.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_JoolInSpaceHigh = The radiation being emitted from Jool is a staggering amount, and you start to wish you were on the Duna exploration mission.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_LaytheInSpaceHigh = Laythe is, incredibly, putting up a large resistance to the onslaught of Jool's radiation belt. God speed Laythe. God speed.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_VallInSpaceHigh = Even though Vall isn't located in the main radiation belt, it is still viciously punished by Jool's radiation.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_TyloInSpaceHigh = The radiation from Jool forms an intense belt around Tylo, but luckily it doesn’t look like much reaches the surface. But much is a relative term.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_BopInSpaceHigh = Bop actually seems to be a source of intense radiation, but amongst Jool's radiation field, it doesn’t appear significant.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_PolInSpaceHigh = Pol is far enough away from Jool that it receives ionized isotopes sourced from Jool's magnetosphere and interplanetary gas.
		#KERBALISM_GeigerCounterScience_EelooInSpaceHigh = As Kerbol's influence weakens, interstellar radiation becomes much more pronounced. The secrets of the galaxy lay open to you.
