//===============================================
// Miscellaneous stuff, mostly internal patch ordering 
// logic and explanations as to why this is so convoluted.
//===============================================

// Patch ordering logic:
//	FIRST				-		Adding Configure Groups. Patching temporary tweaking values. If you want to add a pre-set Configure group to a specific part, now is the time.
//	LEGACY				-		Adding all the Experiment MODULEs, patching the Configure MODULEs and their respective SETUPs. If you want to add specific Experiments to a part, while still being hit by every other patch, this is the time to do it.
//			Patching configure group compositions should be done anywhere inbetween LEGACY and BEFORE[Kerbalism]
// 	BEFORE[Kerbalism]	-		Global reconfiguration of kerbalism experiments, all antennas and all hard drives.
//	FOR[Kerbalism]		-		Individual part tweaks for ALREADY EXISTING Experiment MODULEs. This is where you can change Drive sizes, Experiment parameters, etc to different values compared to the global patch. 
								//Done before the upgrades are applied, in order for upgrade values to be calculated correctly.
								// Patching a part that was reconfigured by us at this point may not work, depending on which patch is applied later - ours or yours (depending on folder name).
//	AFTER[Kerbalism]	-		Global Upgrades for relevant parts. Values are calculated based on how the modules were configured by this point.
								// NOTE:	Should you wish to patch a part differently compared to how we configured it, you would have to do it at a later point than
								// AFTER[Kerbalism]. In this case, you would have to patch the upgrades as well, because upgrades calculate their values at this point.
// FOR[zzzKerbalism]	-		EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION patches. This is done this late because quite a lot of mods do minor tweaks to them throughout the patching process.

// There is one notable exception to that logic:
// 		The slot upgrades for the Configure groups are applied during :BEFORE[Kerbalism]. The reason is, :FOR is reserved for individual part tweaks ONLY.
//		therefore, if a player wants to set different slots for individual parts, they can do that during :FOR[Kerbalism]. This requires patching both the base slots and the upgrade.

// Technically, this could have been done in a single node, but for troubleshooting reasons, they were separated. Readability, ease of access and all.
