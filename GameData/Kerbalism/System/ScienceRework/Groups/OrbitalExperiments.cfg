// Gravioli for now. this group is not added to any stock parts.
// this is mainly for mods such as DMagicOrbitalScience, Bluedog_DB, etc.
// there's no point in adding kerbalism's own experiments for now, as these mods add more than enough, 
// therefore this category is already covered. may revisit later if i can come up with new experiments.
// will probably be added to the M700 orbital scanner in that case.
