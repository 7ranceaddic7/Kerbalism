		// ********** Part: kerbalism-activeshield

		#kerbalism-activeshield_Part_description = Generate a magnetic field around the vessel, reducing incoming radiation. The effect is significant only in relation to the radiation levels encountered in interplanetary flight, and will do little to nothing inside super-charged particle belts or during solar storms.
		#kerbalism-activeshield_Part_manufacturer = TripleZeta Workshops
		#kerbalism-activeshield_Part_title = Active Shield

		// ********** Part: kerbalism-antenna

		// ********** Part: kerbalism-container-inline-125

		#kerbalism-container-inline-125_Part_description = One of the guys at JPL had a simple and brilliant idea: bigger containers to store more supplies. After a couple thousands man-months and 300M in fundings, the prototype was ready for early testing.

		// ********** Part: kerbalism-container-inline-250

		#kerbalism-container-inline-250_Part_description = After the extravagant excesses of the previous generation of space-grade supply containers, the fiscal department wasn't very happy of funding development of an even bigger one. When one of the clerks complained about the rationale behind 'putting men in space for the sake of it', JPL switched to war-mode and blackmailed all bureaucrats involved into submission. And the project was approved in the earnest.
