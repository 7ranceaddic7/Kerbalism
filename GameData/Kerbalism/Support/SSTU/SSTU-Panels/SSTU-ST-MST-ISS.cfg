// this panel has 2 suncatchers with the same name, and I can only get 1 to work. The 2nd panel does not pivot and does not generate EC
//This is not fixable with stock modules due to the way shadowmage indexed his pivots and animations, which can only work with
//SSTUSolarPanelDeployable. The only functional workaround i found was to use Nertea's ModuleCurvedSolarPanel to generate EC, and 
//let SSTU handle the animations. Stock module messes with the animation, if i don't include animation it throws a NRE.
//This patch will ONLY work if you have NFE installed in combination with sstu and kerbalism. If even 1 is missing, it will do nothing.
//The panel still needs to track the sun to generate EC while vessel is active, and generates EC in the background sim when unfocused.
//Removed ability to generate EC for SSTU Module to compensate, left the rest untouched as it needs to handle the animations/tracking.
