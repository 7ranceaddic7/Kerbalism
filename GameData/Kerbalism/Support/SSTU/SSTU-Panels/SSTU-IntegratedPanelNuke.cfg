//after spending 3 days on it, integrated panels are not fixable (at least i cannot find a way to do it)
//and keep the functionality of having multiple options/upgrades for solar.
//As the integrated panels do not generate EC in the background sim, the best option was to nuke all the options/upgrades,
//remove the ability to select integrated panels and allow you to add them back manually (add back stand-alone panels, those work)
//yes, that's more parts for the vessel, which is against what SSTU tries to achieve, but it is what it is till someone figures how to make them work.

//THIS ONLY REMOVES PANELS FROM PARTS WITH MULTIPLE SOLAR OPTIONS!
